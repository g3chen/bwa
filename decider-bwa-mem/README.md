## BWA-MEM Decider

Version 1.4.1, Niassa version 2.0.2

### Overview

This decider launches the [BWA-MEM Workflow](../workflow-bwa-mem) on paired-end FastQ files. Pairs are identified by IUS accession, and the decider relies on hints in the filename to determine whether a file is read 1 or read 2. File details including IUS, run name, lane, barcode, library, platform, sample name, and group ID are pulled from the metadata to include in the generated INI files.

Please see [basic deciders](https://seqware.github.io/docs/6-pipeline/basic_deciders) for additional information.

### Validation and Filtering

The following are causes for the decider to skip passing a file on to a workflow run.
* Library template type: The decider only accepts files with library template types WG, EX, TS and NN
* Missing tissue type value: Every fastq file should have a tissue type in LIMS \('n' for unknown is acceptable\)
* Tissue type is Xenograph, but the file doesn't appear to be a Xenome output \(the decider checks for "xenome" in the filename\)
* Read 1 or read 2 missing: The workflow is designed for aligning paired end reads, and requires two files

### SAM Read Group Header

Using file metadata, the decider will set read group header values in this format:
* ID: runName-barcode_lane
* LB: librarySample
* PL: sequencerRunPlatformName
* PU: \(same as ID\)
* SM: donor_tissueOrigin_tissueType\[_groupId\]

Example result:

```
'@RG    ID:130110_SN804_0104_AD1NPCACXX-NoIndex_6    LB:ASHPC_0005_Pa_R_PE_700_WG    PL:ILLUMINA    PU:130110_SN804_0104_AD1NPCACXX-NoIndex_6    SM:PCSI_0350_Pa_n_2'
```

### Compile

```
mvn clean install
```

### Usage
```
java -jar Decider.jar --study-name \<study-name\> --wf-accession \<bwa-mem-workflow-accession\> --model-to-platform-map <\path to sequencer run model to platform map csv file\>
```

### Options

#### Sequencer Run Model to Platform map file
This file maps sequencer run models to platform. This platform value is used for the "PL" read group.

For example:
```
model,platform
Illumina HiSeq 2500,ILLUMINA
NextSeq 550,ILLUMINA
PacBio RS,PACBIO
454,454
SOLiD,SOLID
```

**Required**
See [basic deciders](https://seqware.github.io/docs/6-pipeline/basic_deciders) for general decider options.
